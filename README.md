Hunty is a decentralized scavenger hunt game built on Stellar/Soroban. Create thrilling scavenger hunts with multiple clues and challenges, engage players in immersive treasure hunts, and reward them with XLM tokens or exclusive NFTs.


## What is Hunty?

Imagine a treasure hunt where every clue is verified on the blockchain, every answer is secure, and every completion is rewarded with real value. That's Hunty.

Hunty transforms the classic scavenger hunt into a decentralized gaming experience. Hunt creators design custom challenges with multiple clues, each leading players closer to completion. Players race to solve clues, with their progress tracked transparently on-chain. When they complete all clues, they're rewarded with XLM tokens or unique NFTs that commemorate their achievement.

The beauty of Hunty lies in its simplicity and security. Answers are hashed on-chain, so no one can cheat by looking at the contract. Multiple hunts can run simultaneously, and players can participate in as many as they want. The entire system is trustless, transparent, and built on Stellar's fast, low-cost blockchain.

## Game Overview

### Leaderboard notes

- **Scan limitation**: For gas safety, the on-chain `get_hunt_leaderboard` query scans a bounded number of player records (default cap in contract). For very popular hunts with many registrations, use the new paginated API `get_hunt_leaderboard_window` to page through registered players in windows and merge results off-chain to build a full top-N leaderboard.


### The Big Picture

Hunty operates as a three-contract system where each contract has a specific role:

1. **HuntyCore** - The game master that manages hunts, verifies answers, and tracks progress
2. **RewardManager** - The treasurer that coordinates and distributes rewards
3. **NftReward** - The mint that creates unique NFT trophies for completing players

Here's how they work together:

### How It Works

#### Creating a Hunt

Anyone can become a hunt creator. Here's what happens when you create a hunt:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Creator
    participant HuntyCore
    participant Storage
    
    Creator->>HuntyCore: create_hunt(title, description)
    HuntyCore->>HuntyCore: Generate unique hunt ID
    HuntyCore->>HuntyCore: Initialize hunt (status: Draft)
    HuntyCore->>Storage: Store hunt data
    HuntyCore->>Creator: Return hunt ID
    
    Creator->>HuntyCore: add_clue(hunt_id, question, answer)
    HuntyCore->>HuntyCore: Hash answer (SHA256)
    HuntyCore->>Storage: Store clue with hashed answer
    HuntyCore->>Creator: Clue added
    
    Note over Creator,HuntyCore: Repeat for all clues
    
    Creator->>HuntyCore: activate_hunt(hunt_id)
    HuntyCore->>HuntyCore: Validate hunt has clues
    HuntyCore->>Storage: Update status to Active
    HuntyCore->>Creator: Hunt activated!
```

**Key Points:**
- Hunts start in "Draft" status, so you can add clues before going live
- Answers are hashed using SHA256 before storage - this keeps them secret until someone solves them
- Only the creator can add clues and activate the hunt
- Once active, players can register and start playing

#### Playing a Hunt

The player experience is straightforward but exciting:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Player
    participant HuntyCore
    participant Storage
    
    Player->>HuntyCore: register_player(hunt_id)
    HuntyCore->>HuntyCore: Check hunt is Active
    HuntyCore->>Storage: Initialize player progress
    HuntyCore->>Player: Registration successful!
    
    Note over Player,HuntyCore: Player solves clues...
    
    Player->>HuntyCore: submit_answer(hunt_id, clue_id, answer)
    HuntyCore->>HuntyCore: Hash submitted answer
    HuntyCore->>Storage: Get stored answer hash
    HuntyCore->>HuntyCore: Compare hashes
    
    alt Answer is correct
        HuntyCore->>Storage: Update progress (add clue, update score)
        HuntyCore->>Player: Correct! Clue completed
    else Answer is incorrect
        HuntyCore->>Player: Incorrect answer
    end
    
    Note over Player,HuntyCore: Player completes all required clues...
    
    Player->>HuntyCore: complete_hunt(hunt_id)
    HuntyCore->>HuntyCore: Verify all clues completed
    HuntyCore->>Storage: Mark hunt as completed for player
    HuntyCore->>Player: Hunt completed! Rewards processing...
```

**Key Points:**
- Players can register for any active hunt
- Answers are verified on-chain by comparing hashes
- Progress is tracked transparently - you can see which clues you've completed
- Case-insensitive matching means "Paris" and "paris" both work
- Once all required clues are solved, the hunt is marked complete

#### Reward Distribution

This is where it gets exciting - players get rewarded for their efforts:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Player
    participant HuntyCore
    participant RewardManager
    participant XlmHandler
    participant NftHandler
    participant NftReward
    
    Player->>HuntyCore: complete_hunt(hunt_id)
    HuntyCore->>HuntyCore: Verify completion
    HuntyCore->>RewardManager: distribute_rewards(hunt_id, player, config)
    
    RewardManager->>RewardManager: Determine reward type
    
    alt XLM Rewards
        RewardManager->>XlmHandler: distribute_xlm(player, amount)
        XlmHandler->>XlmHandler: Validate reward pool
        XlmHandler->>Player: Transfer XLM
        XlmHandler->>RewardManager: Distribution complete
    end
    
    alt NFT Rewards
        RewardManager->>NftHandler: distribute_nft(player, metadata)
        NftHandler->>NftReward: mint_reward_nft(hunt_id, player, metadata)
        NftReward->>NftReward: Generate unique NFT ID
        NftReward->>NftReward: Store NFT metadata
        NftReward->>NftHandler: NFT minted
        NftHandler->>NftReward: transfer_nft(nft_id, player)
        NftReward->>Player: NFT transferred
        NftHandler->>RewardManager: Distribution complete
    end
    
    RewardManager->>Player: All rewards distributed!
```

**Key Points:**
- Rewards can be XLM tokens, NFTs, or both
- XLM is transferred directly to the player's wallet
- NFTs are minted on-demand and include hunt completion details
- Each NFT is unique and serves as a collectible trophy
- The entire process is automated and trustless

## Architecture

Hunty consists of three main smart contracts:

1. **HuntyCore** - Main game logic, hunt management, and clue verification
2. **RewardManager** - Coordinates reward distribution (XLM and NFT)
3. **NftReward** - Handles NFT minting and transfer for completion rewards

### Contract Responsibilities

**HuntyCore Contract:**
- Manages the entire hunt lifecycle (creation, activation, completion)
- Stores and verifies clue answers using cryptographic hashes
- Tracks player progress and scores
- Coordinates with RewardManager when hunts are completed
- Provides query functions for hunt information and leaderboards

**RewardManager Contract:**
- Receives completion notifications from HuntyCore
- Determines reward type (XLM, NFT, or both)
- Manages reward pools and validates sufficient funds
- Routes to appropriate handlers (XLM or NFT)
- Tracks reward distribution status

**NftReward Contract:**
- Mints unique NFTs when players complete hunts
- Stores NFT metadata including hunt information
- Manages NFT ownership and transfers
- Provides query functions for NFT information

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable version)
- [Stellar CLI](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/getting-started/setup)
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Samuel1-ona/Hunty-contract.git
cd Hunty-contract

# Build all contracts
cd contracts/hunty-core && make build
cd ../reward-manager && make build
cd ../nft-reward && make build
```

### Environment Configuration

The API is configured with explicit environment files so development/testnet, QA/staging, and mainnet deployments do not share contract addresses or RPC settings.

Available templates:

- `.env.testnet` for development and testnet integration work
- `.env.staging` for QA/pre-production validation on dedicated staging contracts
- `.env.mainnet` for production mainnet deployment
- `.env.example` as the shared reference template

Required variables are validated when the API starts. Startup fails fast with a clear error if a value is missing, invalid, or still contains a `replace-with-...` placeholder.

```bash
# Development/testnet
pnpm dev:testnet

# QA/staging
pnpm dev:staging

# Environment-specific builds
pnpm build:testnet
pnpm build:staging
pnpm build:mainnet

# Start compiled output with an environment file
pnpm start:staging
```

Contract addresses are tracked per environment in:

- `config/contracts.testnet.json`
- `config/contracts.staging.json`
- `config/contracts.mainnet.json`

Keep these files in sync with the matching `.env.<environment>` file after each deployment.

Browser-facing environment visibility:

- `GET /health` returns the active environment, Stellar network, RPC URL, and contract IDs.
- `GET /environment` renders a visible environment badge for `testnet` and `staging` only; mainnet returns `204 No Content` so no production badge is shown.

### Environment Deployments

Build contract WASMs first, then deploy to the target environment:

```bash
stellar contract build

# Testnet development deployment
scripts/deploy_contracts.sh testnet myaccount

# Dedicated QA/pre-production deployment
scripts/deploy_contracts.sh staging staging-deployer

# Mainnet deployment; requires MAINNET_RPC_URL
MAINNET_RPC_URL=https://... scripts/deploy_contracts.sh mainnet mainnet-deployer
```

The deploy script writes the deployed contract IDs to `config/contracts.<environment>.json`. Copy the resulting IDs into the corresponding `.env.<environment>` values:

```bash
HUNTY_CORE_ID=...
REWARD_MANAGER_ID=...
NFT_REWARD_ID=...
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Test individual contracts
cd contracts/hunty-core && make test
cd ../reward-manager && make test
cd ../nft-reward && make test

# Or test all contracts from root
cargo test --workspace
```
