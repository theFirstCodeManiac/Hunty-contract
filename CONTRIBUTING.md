# Contributing to Hunty

Hey there! 👋 Thanks for wanting to contribute to Hunty. We're excited to have you on board! This guide will help you get started and make your first contribution smooth and enjoyable.


## First Things First

Before diving in, let's make sure you have everything you need to get started. Don't worry if you're new to Soroban or Rust - we've all been there, and we're here to help!

### What You'll Need


- **Rust** - We're using the latest stable version, so make sure yours is up to date
- **Stellar CLI** - You'll need the `stellar` command installed for building contracts
- **Git** - For version control (you probably already have this!)
- **Basic Soroban knowledge** - Don't worry if you're still learning! We have good first issues that are perfect for getting your feet wet


### Getting Your Environment Ready

Let's get your development environment set up. It's pretty straightforward:

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Samuel1-ona/Hunty-contract.git
   cd Hunty-contract
   ```

2. **Build everything:**
   This will compile all three contracts. Grab a coffee ☕ - first builds can take a minute!
   ```bash
   cd contracts/hunty-core && make build
   cd ../reward-manager && make build
   cd ../nft-reward && make build
   ```

3. **Run the tests:**
   Make sure everything works before you start making changes:
   ```bash
   cd contracts/hunty-core && make test
   cd ../reward-manager && make test
   cd ../nft-reward && make test
   ```

If all the tests pass, you're good to go! 🎉

## Understanding the Project Structure

Here's how we've organized things. Don't worry about memorizing this - you'll get familiar with it as you work:

```
hunty-contract/
├── contracts/
│   ├── hunty-core/          # This is where the main game logic lives
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   │   ├── lib.rs       # The heart of the contract - main functions here
│   │   │   ├── types.rs     # All our data structures (Hunt, Clue, etc.)
│   │   │   ├── storage.rs   # How we save and retrieve data
│   │   │   ├── errors.rs    # Custom error types for better error messages
│   │   │   └── test.rs      # Tests go here - write lots of these!
│   │   └── Cargo.toml
│   ├── reward-manager/      # Handles all the reward distribution magic
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   │   ├── lib.rs       # Main reward coordination logic
│   │   │   ├── xlm_handler.rs  # XLM token distribution

│   └── nft-reward/          # Creates those cool NFT trophies
│       ├── src/
│       │   ├── lib.rs
│       │   └── test.rs
│       └── Cargo.toml
├── Cargo.toml               # Workspace config - don't touch this unless you know what you're doing
└── README.md
```

## Finding Something to Work On

Not sure where to start? That's totally fine! Here are some ways to find the perfect issue for you:

### Check Out Our Issues

Head over to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Samuel1-ona/Hunty-contract/issues) and look for labels that match your experience level:

- **good first issue** 🟢 - Perfect if you're new! These are designed to be approachable and help you learn the codebase
- **enhancement** 🟡 - Adding new features or improving existing ones
- **bug** 🔴 - Something's broken and needs fixing
- **documentation** 📝 - Help us explain things better - great for writers!
- **refactor** 🔧 - Making code cleaner and more maintainable


### Still Not Sure?

If you're feeling overwhelmed, start with:
1. Issues labeled "good first issue" - we specifically set these up for newcomers
2. Documentation improvements - these are low-stress and help everyone
3. Test coverage - writing tests is a great way to understand how things work

## Your Development Workflow

Here's the process we follow. It might seem like a lot at first, but it becomes second nature pretty quickly:

### 1. Create a Branch

Always work on a branch - never commit directly to main! This keeps things organized and makes it easy to review your work.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or for bug fixes:
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

**Pro tip:** Make your branch name descriptive. `feature/add-multi-answer-support` is way better than `feature/stuff`!

### 2. Make Your Changes

This is the fun part! A few things to keep in mind:

- **Follow existing patterns** - Look at how similar code is written in the project
- **Write tests** - Seriously, write tests. Your future self (and code reviewers) will thank you
- **Update docs** - If you're adding a new feature, make sure the docs reflect it
- **Keep it simple** - The best code is code that's easy to understand

### 3. Test Everything

Before you commit, make sure everything still works:

```bash
make test
```

If tests fail, don't panic! Read the error messages - they're usually pretty helpful. And if you're stuck, ask for help. We've all been there.

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Write a clear commit message that explains what you did and why:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add support for multiple valid answers per clue

This allows hunt creators to accept variations like 'Paris' or 'paris'
as correct answers, making the system more user-friendly."
```

**Good commit messages:**
- Explain what changed
- Explain why (if it's not obvious)
- Are written in present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

### 5. Push and Create a Pull Request

Once you're happy with your changes:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then head over to GitHub and create a pull request. In your PR description, tell us:
- What you changed
- Why you changed it
- How to test it
- Any questions or concerns you have

## Code Style Guidelines

We're not super strict, but consistency helps everyone. Here's what we prefer:

- **Follow Rust conventions** - `cargo fmt` is your friend, use it!
- **Add comments** - Especially for complex logic. we will appreciate it
- **Descriptive names** - `calculate_player_score()` is better than `calc()`
- **Keep functions focused** - If a function does too many things, consider breaking it up

Run `cargo fmt` before committing - it'll format your code automatically. Easy win! ✨

## Testing - It's Important!

We can't stress this enough: **write tests**. They're not just for catching bugs - they're also documentation that shows how your code is supposed to work.

### What to Test

- **Happy paths** - Does it work when everything goes right?
- **Edge cases** - What happens with empty inputs? Invalid data? Boundary conditions?
- **Error conditions** - Does it fail gracefully with helpful error messages?
- **Integration** - If you're calling other contracts, test that interaction

### Our Testing Goals

- Aim for >80% code coverage 
- Test edge cases - these are where bugs hide
- Include integration tests for cross-contract calls
- Make tests readable - they should tell a story

## Submitting Your Pull Request

You've written the code, written the tests, and everything passes. Awesome! Now let's get it reviewed:

### Before You Submit

- ✅ All tests pass (locally and in CI)
- ✅ Documentation is updated (if needed)
- ✅ Code is formatted (`cargo fmt`)
- ✅ You've tested your changes manually (if applicable)

### Writing Your PR Description

A good PR description helps reviewers understand your work quickly:

```markdown
## What This Does
Adds support for multiple valid answers per clue, allowing hunt creators
to accept variations like "Paris", "paris", or "City of Light" as correct.

## Why
Some clues have multiple valid answers, and we want to be flexible while
still maintaining security through hash verification.

## Testing
- Added unit tests for multi-answer verification
- Tested with various answer formats
- Verified backward compatibility with single-answer clues

## Related Issues
Closes #21
```

### The Review Process

Don't take feedback personally! Code reviews are about making the code better, not criticizing you. We're all learning and improving together.



## Contract-Specific Tips

Each contract has its own quirks. Here's what to know:

### HuntyCore Contract

This is the main game logic, so it's pretty important:

- **types.rs** - Define all your data structures here. Keep them organized and well-documented
- **storage.rs** - Storage access patterns. Make sure keys are unique and consistent
- **errors.rs** - Custom errors make debugging way easier. Use them!
- **lib.rs** - Main contract logic. Keep functions focused and testable

### RewardManager Contract

This coordinates rewards, so precision matters:

- Coordinate with both XLM and NFT handlers - they need to work together
- Ensure atomic operations - either everything succeeds or nothing does
- Handle edge cases gracefully - what if a transfer fails? What if the pool is empty?

### NftReward Contract

NFTs are cool, but they need to be done right:

- Follow Stellar NFT standards - this ensures compatibility
- Keep metadata consistent - it's what makes each NFT unique
- Track ownership properly - this is critical for transfers
